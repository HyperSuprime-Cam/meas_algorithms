         * @brief This class includes the basic functionality for shapelets
         *
         * There are a few definitions of shapelets out there.  
         * This class implements the shapelets defined in 
         * Bernstein & Jarvis (2002) (where they are called the
         * Gauss-Laguerre basis functions).
         * These are similar to the "polar shapelets" of Massey &
         * Refregier.  
         *
         * Shapelets are a complete basis set that can be used to 
         * describe any image.  However, they are most useful for 
         * describing things that are intrinsically similar to a 
         * 2-d Gaussian.  Since the PSF (for ground-based telescopes)
         * is dominated by a Gaussian component, this makes them
         * a good choice for describing the PSF.
         *
         * For specificity, the basis functions we use are:
         *
         * For p >= q:
         * psi_pq(x,y,sigma) = (pi p! q!)^-1/2 z^m exp(-r^2/2) K_pq(r^2)
         * where z = (x + Iy)/sigma
         *       m = p-q
         *       r = |z|^2
         *       K_pq(r^2) = (-)^q q! L_q^(m) (r^2)
         *       L_q^(m)(x) are Laguerre polynomials
         *
         * For any particular value of sigma, these define a complete
         * set of basis functions.
         *
         * The image is thus decomposed as:
         *
         * f(x,y) = Sum_pq b_pq psi_pq(x,y)
         *
         * As with any basis set, the decomposition is only exact 
         * if an infinite number of basis functions are used.
         * We truncate the expansion at p+q <= order
         * for some (specified) order.

         * The initial estimate of sigma is the value given by 
         * this->getSigma().
         *
         * The normal operation would be to allow both values to shift to 
         * find the best values for the image.  However, there are reasons
         * to keep each fixed.
         *
         * First, if we have very accurate positions given in the source 
         * object, and we want the PSF to include the centroid shift that 
         * is present in the seeing, then this would be a good reason to 
         * keep it fixed.
         *
         * Second, interpolation of the PSF is more straightforward
         * if all the stars are measured with the saem sigma.
         * So the normal practice is to let sigma float for each
         * star, then find the mean of all the stars in an image,
         * and finally remeasure each star with this constant
         * value of sigma.
         *
         * So, there are two boolean parameters that govern what 
         * should be kept fixed during the calculation.
         *
         * isCentroidFixed says whether to keep the centoid fixed.  
         * If it is false, then the centoid is allowed to vary until
         * b10 = 0 (our definition of being centroided).
         *
         * isSigmaFixed says whether to keep the sigma fixed.
         * If it is false, then sigma is allowed to vary until 
         * b11 = 0 (which corresponds to when the measured shapelet 
         * components have the maximum signal-to-noise).
         *
         * The measurement is done using a circular aperture,
         * whose radius is given by the paremeter aperture.
         * This aperture (given in arcsec) defines a circle in
         * _sky_ coordinates, not chip coordinates.
         *
         * The return value is true if the measurement is successful,
         * and falso if not.
