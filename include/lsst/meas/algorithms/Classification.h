 *  @brief Control/factory for the algorithm that does star/galaxy classification
 *
 *  The algorithm class itself adds nothing to the public interface of its base class, so
 *  it is declared only in the source file.
 *
 *  This algorithm is based entirely on the ratio of Model to PSF fluxes; it never fails unless 
 *  one of these fails, so it does not have its own failure flag.
 *
 *  @todo this class needs a more specific name, especially now that classifiers are pluggable
